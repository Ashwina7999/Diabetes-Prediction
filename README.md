# Diabetes-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict whether the patient is having Diabetes diseases or not.
# Prediction of diabetes using ML

This is a machine learning project to predict whether a person has diabetes or not, based on information about the patient such as Pregnancies, Glucose, blood pressure, SkinThickness, body mass index (BMI), age, etc.

### Data Description

The following features have been provided to help us predict whether a person is diabetic or not:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
* Age: Age (years)
* Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

### Libraries used

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
